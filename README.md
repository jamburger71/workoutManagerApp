# Workout Manager App

## Introduction

This app was developed as part of the Android Development module in my 3rd year of study of the Software Engineering degree.
It aims to provide users a way to manage their workouts with various features.
It was previously hosted on the university's private gitlab.

## Technical Features

- Written in Kotlin
- Uses local storage via an SQL database and Data Store Preferences
- Provides an interactive interface with a navigation bar

## What could have been different

A lot of features of this app are basic and rudimentary, and there is a clear lack of exploiting of the features Jetpack Compose provides. For example, in situations where i could use an Animated Visibility and Card, I instead relied on an if statement and boxes, which give a much weaker appearance. There is also opportunity for automated testing that was not taken.
